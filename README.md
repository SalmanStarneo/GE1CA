# GE1CA

# Project Title: Dimensional Travel.

Name:Salman Alsamiri

Student Number: D18124618

Class Group:TU856/4

# Description of the project
The Project will follow the previous idea, but with little changes, like a SeaWater Plane will be included along with perlin noise generated Terrain
that will mimic rocks under the water. The Idea will remain about a vehicle that will be moving endlessly but rather than a tunnel it will be flying over the Ocean in an
illusion that it is traveling across to different worlds far over the horizen. The ship is made using Blender and insearted as an GameObject that will act as a child to the
camera where the camera will display a 3rd person view of the vehicle flying.
----------------
# Instructions for use:

- if there is any controls built in it will be to do simple movement around, 
and maybe shoot projectile into the floating objects or do barrel rolls (if it will not be a grounded vehicle).

- if there is no movement invloved then it will just include music changing based on button clicks, location of the vehicle or somthing else.
----------------
# How it works
by running the unity project displaying an illusion of a flight through a starry sky across the sea to journey to different new worlds

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
- The *skybox*.
- The *water plane*.
- Spent hours debugging the Render Pipeline and 
fixing the graphic settings for unity, so that the sheders works properly.

- Fixing the planet display and metrial, as after getting the universal pipeline working for 
the other objects it took a while for to have it retain its matrial.

- Making complex low poly model in blender.
- transfering blender model to unity and setting colours to the gameObject models.


# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
My Idea for the Game Engine 1 CA is to create a scene where a vehicle that will be going through an endless(Looping) tunnle with colourful objects floating around,   
as it will be similar to the scenes from digimon our war game movie when they go through internet connection tunnels and space oddesy movie hyper speed scene, 
where it will change colour, move and float around with the beat of the music.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
